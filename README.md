# Bank-Marketing-Analysis
â€¢	Business Recommendation
This project is about helping any industry like bank or commerce to attract their targeted customers via advertising campaign in a most effective way that can save their money and time in the campaign. For these project, I would suggest the Portuguese bank that they should focus ojn customers that are doing technical, admin or management related jobs during their next telemarketing campaign as they are most likely to make a one-month deposit with the bank. Also, the duration of the call is the most significant factor pertaining to someone will make a one-month deposit with a bank or not. So, they should try to convince customer with a long conversation on phone and explain them about the benefits as we discovered that the more is the duration of call the more are chances of the customer to make a one-month deposit with the bank. Moreover, the bank can use our decision tree or K-nearest neighbor algorithm during their next campaign, input the details about their customer one of the models, determine the customers that are most likely to make a one-month deposit and only contact those customers which will save their time and money during a future marketing campaign.
